    <h1>Katelyn Wong</h1>
    <h3>Master's Student at UCSD Halicioglu Data Science Institute &#8212 <span class="bold">Data Science, Math,
        Economics</span></h3>
    <p>Hi! I'm Katelyn Wong, a Master’s student in Data Science at UC San Diego, with a BS in Mathematics and
      Economics and a minor in Data Science. I’m passionate about data analysis, mathematical modeling, and applied
      research, using computational and statistical methods to tackle real-world problems.</p>

    <p>
      I have experience in data science research and projects, including modeling energy data at UCSD’s Renewable Energy
      and Advanced Mathematics Lab, building predictive models for survival rates, user preferences, language
      prediction, and creating interactive data visualizations and developing my own coffee blog website from scratch.
    </p>

    <p>
      Through my experiences working with the San Diego Association of Governments, UCSD's math department, and
      TritonHacks, I've
      strengthened my skills in algorithms, statistics, optimization, and web development, while also gaining
      valuable teamwork, problem-solving, and leadership experience through finance, mentoring, and administrative
      roles.
    </p>

    <p>
      Outside of data science, I’m passionate about coffee and music. I run a coffee blog documenting cafe explorations
      and brewing techniques, and I enjoy producing and sharing music that inspires me. These hobbies reflect my
      curiosity, creativity, and dedication to exploring interests deeply.

          </p>
          <p class="indent">This current research direction of this project is to develop a dynamic electricity pricing
            model for CAISO using Avoided
            Cost time series data. By leveraging trends from existing pricing models and incorporating a penalty
            parameter for policy- and economics-driven regularization, the hybrid statistical model seeks to minimize
            deviation from market electricity values while promoting cost-efficiency, renewable energy adoption, and
            transparent pricing for consumers.</p>

          </p>
          <p class="indent">At UC San Diego’s URC, an inclusive event celebrating undergraduate research excellence, I
            presented my work modeling electricity pricing for SDG&E using CAISO data. I developed four benchmark
            statistical prediction models before conducting multivariable regression analyses for marginal and fixed
            costs, identifying the optimal combination of variables to accurately predict electricity rates. This
            project applies rigorous statistical modeling and data analysis to real-world energy
            systems.</p>

          <p class="indent">This project analyzed historical wildfire and weather data (2012–2015) in the United States
            to identify meteorological factors that predict wildfire severity, measured by acres burned. Using data
            integration and statistical analysis, I found that low humidity, lower temperatures, high wind speed, and
            high-pressure systems were associated with larger wildfires, while regions closer to the equator also tended
            to experience more severe fires. The study highlights key environmental drivers of wildfire risk and
            provides a framework for informing prevention strategies, resource allocation, and future predictive
            modeling.</p>

          </p>
          <p class="indent">In this project, I analyzed two datasets from Food.com: one containing nutritional and
            instructional information about recipes, and the other capturing user interactions and account data. I
            explored how recipe attributes, particularly nutritional content like fat levels, influence user ratings.
            The study focused on whether higher-fat recipes receive higher ratings on average, providing insights into
            how users balance taste and health. These findings can inform strategies to optimize recipe presentation and
            engagement on the platform.</p>

          </p>
          <p class="indent">Building on my analysis from part 1, I developed a machine learning model to predict
            the total fat content of a recipe based on its features, including nutritional information and user ratings.
            Total fat was chosen as the response variable to further explore its relationship with other recipe
            attributes, building on prior findings that higher-fat recipes tend to receive higher ratings. I framed this
            as a regression problem and evaluated the model using both R² and RMSE scores to capture both correlation
            and large prediction errors. This project is an example of utilizing exploratory data insights into
            predictive modeling, and applying appropriate evaluation metrics for regression tasks.</p>

          <p class="indent">This research applied statistical methods and data analysis to examine international suicide
            rates across different age groups. Using R, I conducted data cleaning, visualization, and statistical
            analysis with techniques such as ANOVA and Tukey's HSD tests, while addressing challenges like non-normal
            data distributions.</p>

          <p class="indent">The study investigated differences in suicide rates across age groups, testing the null
            hypothesis that
            rates do not differ versus the alternative that they do. A specific focus was on whether rates are highest
            among the 55–74 age group, informed by midlife crisis trends. Post-hoc comparisons were used to evaluate
            these hypotheses and identify significant patterns across age groups.</p>
