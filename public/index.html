    <h1>Katelyn Wong</h1>
    <h3>Master's Student at UCSD Halicioglu Data Science Institute &#8212 Data Science, Math, Economics</h3>
    <p>Hi! I'm Katelyn Wong, a Master’s student in Data Science at UC San Diego, with a BS in Mathematics and
      Economics and a minor in Data Science. I’m passionate about data analysis, mathematical modeling, and applied
      research, using computational and statistical methods to tackle real-world problems.</p>

    <p>
      I have experience in data science research and projects, including modeling energy data at UCSD’s Renewable Energy
      and Advanced Mathematics Lab, building predictive models for survival rates, user preferences, language
      prediction, and creating interactive data visualizations and developing my own coffee blog website from scratch.
    </p>

    <p>
      Through my experiences working with the San Diego Association of Governments, UCSD's math department, and TritonHacks, I've 
      strengthened my skills in algorithms, statistics, optimization, and web development, while also gaining
      valuable teamwork, problem-solving, and leadership experience through finance, mentoring, and administrative
      roles.
    </p>

    <p>
      Outside of data science, I’m passionate about coffee and music. I run a coffee blog documenting cafe explorations
      and brewing techniques, and I enjoy producing and sharing music that inspires me. These hobbies reflect my
      curiosity, creativity, and dedication to exploring interests deeply.
    </p>
